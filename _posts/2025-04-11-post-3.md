## Introduction

The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) provides wage and employment statistics to the public every year. As of this post, the most recent data published is for the year 2024. As a college student exploring different career paths, having an idea of the pay ranges of various job fields can inform my decisions. I explored the 2024 table from the BLS to see the most updated statistics.

## A Few Findings

The first thing most people want to see is which jobs make the most money. Here are the top 10 occupations with the highest salary, along with the estimate of how many people are employed under that title:

| Title      | Mean Annual Wage      | Estimated Total Employment      |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Pediatric Surgeons   | 450,810   | 1,050   |
| Cardiologists   | 432,490   | 18,020   |
| Surgeons, All Other   | 371,280   |24,080  |
| Orthopedic Surgeons, Except Pediatric  | 365,060  |  14,160 |
| Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons  | 360,240  | 5,330  |
| Radiologists  | 359,820  |  26,290 |
| Dermatologists  |  347,810 | 10,080  |
| Anesthesiologists  |  336,640 |41,890   |
| Emergency Medicine Physicians  |  320,700 |  33,680 |
| Ophthalmologists, Except Pediatric  | 301,500  | 12,110  |

Med school costs a lot of money and time, but clearly it pays off. In case you were wondering, the highest paid non-medicine occupation comes in at number 13: Airline Pilots, Copilots, and Flight Engineers making an average of \$280,570. 

Specialized medical professionals are in high demand, therefore they get paid good money. I've also heard that they commonly face malpractice lawsuits, and have to work long and irregular hours, among other pains. So maybe it's just a tradeoff.

The highest paid pediatric surgeons only have about a thousand practicing, which is relatively scarce. This led me to wonder if there's a correlation between the number of people with a job and how much they're paid. Here's a scatterplot of these variables:

While a handful of jobs are scarce and high wage, or vice versa, for the vast majority there doesn't seem to be a relationship between employment and salary. I tried transforming the variables, and it still does not show a clear pattern. Of course, many factors can influence an occupation's average wage, such as sector, seniority, location, and much more. Unfortunately the public-use BLS statistics don't have that level of detail for us to do a more comprehensive regression analysis. But at least we know that scarcity is not a predictor of salary by itself.

## An Interactive App

If you wish to explore the statistics further, I made a [Streamlit web app](https://jl240-bls-analysis-main-bzc2do.streamlit.app/) that allows you to poke around the data table using intuitive searches and filters. You can access the dataset and code on [this Github repository](https://github.com/jl240/BLS_analysis).

The app is pretty straightforward, so I'll keep the explanation brief. The first tab contains the base table of occupations with key metrics like total employment and mean and median annual wage. The next tab contains some interesting summaries if you want a quick glance at the data. Then on the next tab you can search for a specific job to see some more details on how much they're paid. Finally, in the last tab you can filter the data table in case you want to see what types of jobs fall within a certain salary range.

## Future Work

As a future project, I plan to include data from previous years so that we can see trends over time, but that will require a bit more work because I would need to access the BLS API and account for new or obsolete jobs. Another useful addition could be classifying the occupations into their respective sectors (healthcare, education, government, etc.) to compare them. If you have other ideas for analyzing BLS data or suggestions for the web app, please feel free to contact me through any of the methods provided at the bottom of the page.
