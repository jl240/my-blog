## Introduction

Understanding trends in marital status (single, married, divorced, etc.) in the United States is crucial for analyzing economic patterns. People's views on marriage, divorce, and cohabitation have shifted significantly over the years, impacting the housing market, workforce participation, and public policies. 

This post provides a brief initial analysis of marital trends among the female population over the past decade. Specifically, how has the distribution of marital statuses among females in different age groups changed since 2010?

## Notes on the Data

The data for this analysis was obtained from the [U.S. Census Bureau website](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about.html). The Census Bureau makes many U.S. statistics available to the public. The data requested through their API and the usage of it is in compliance with their terms of service.

Requesting data through the Census Bureau API was quite straightforward. The American Community Survey tables on their website contain data of numerous topics such as education, employment, and health. Once the desired tables are found, the page interface offers several options for retrieving the data. If the API option is selected, it will provide a copyable link through which the user can make a request. A Python script was used to make requests for this analysis.

Unlike traditional APIs which return a convenient JSON, the Census Bureau API returns two lists, where one is the row-column index and the other one is the cell content. Additional processing and matching is needed to select only the desired parts of each table.

To obtain the same table over multiple years, only the "year" parameter inside the API link needs to be changed. A loop can reconstruct the link for each desired year. 

## EDA

The dataset (if put in tidy format) contains 780 observations with 6 features: year, sex, age group, population count, marital status, and percentage of population wtih the respective marital status. Plots showing the trends of marital status over time for females are presented below.
