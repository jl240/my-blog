## Introduction

Understanding trends in marital status (single, married, divorced, etc.) in the United States is crucial for analyzing economic patterns. People's views on marriage, divorce, and cohabitation have shifted significantly over the years, impacting the housing market, workforce participation, and public policies. 

This post provides a brief initial analysis of marital trends among the female population over the past decade. Specifically, how has the distribution of marital statuses among females in different age groups changed since 2010?

## Notes on the Data

The data for this analysis was obtained from the [U.S. Census Bureau website](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about.html). The Census Bureau makes many U.S. statistics available to the public. The data requested through their API and the usage of it is in compliance with their [terms of service](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/about/terms-of-service.html).

Requesting data through the Census Bureau API is quite straightforward. The [American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/) tables on their website contain data of numerous topics such as education, employment, and health. Once the desired tables are found, the page interface offers several options for retrieving the data. If the API option is selected, it will provide a copyable link through which the user can make a request. A Python script was used to make requests for this analysis. A Github repository including the code, dataset, and plots can be found [here](https://github.com/jl240/Marital-Statuses-in-the-United-States).

Unlike traditional APIs which return a convenient JSON, the Census Bureau API returns two lists, where one is the row-column index and the other one is the cell content. Additional processing and matching is needed to select only the desired parts of each table.

To obtain the same table over multiple years, only the "year" parameter inside the API link needs to be changed. A loop can reconstruct the link for each desired year. 

## EDA

The dataset contains 780 observations with 6 features: year, sex, age group, population count, marital status, and the estimated percentage of population wtih the respective marital status. Years range from 2010 to 2023, with 2020 missing due to the pandemic. Plots showing the trends of marital status over time for females are presented below.

### Female Teens

First we explore marital statuses of the female population with ages 15-19.

As the vast majority of teens have the status of Never Married, this category was removed for this age group so that we can look more closely at the trends of the other categories. First we observe that, according to what one might typically expect, only a very small proportion of teen females have been married at some point, and an even smaller proportion have been divorced or separated. Nearly none of them have been widowed. An interesting observation is that the the proportion of teens getting married seems to trend downward.

### Female Young Adults

Here is a summary of the female population with ages 20-34.

We see several interesting trends. The percent of young adult women never married have gradually risen from an estimated 55% to about 64% over the years, and those in the Now Married category have declined from an estimated 37% to about 32%. A more rigorous economic analysis would be necessary to describe this phenomenon, but a likely preliminary explanation is that fewer and fewer young adult women are getting married, and those who are already married are moving to the next age group. Thus currently, most young adult women are not married, even more than in 2010. As the proportion getting married has been declining over the past decade while those in other statuses have remained mostly constant, we expect the proportion of young women getting married to continue its decline in coming years.


### Female Middle-Aged Adults

Finally, the female popuzlation with ages 35-64.

We observe that the proportions of female middle-aged adults in each marital status has remained mostly constant throughout the years. There has been an estimated 62% of middle-aged adult women in the United States who were married at the time of the survey, at least since 2010. While this has remained somewhat constant, the proportion of those never married have been very slightly rising. There could be numerous explanations for this. Unfortunately, the available data is only the proportions of the U.S. population measured yearly with different subjects, and not tracking individual status changes. This limitation restricts us from making conclusions about the social trends beyond what the numbers explicitly show.


## Conclusion

In this post we have done a shallow exploration of the marital status trends of females among different age groups in the United States. Much work is needed before making any meaningful conclusions that could inform an analysis of economic trends. To investigate the cause of the changing marriage trends, future analyses can connect this data to surveys of shifting marriage decisions and public policies that affect those decisions. Additionally, these changing marriage trends could have an impact on the broader economy, such as the population size and markets involving married couples and families, although such an analysis would require more time to elapse for the effects to naturally occur to produce sufficient data.
