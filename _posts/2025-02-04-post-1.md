## Introduction

Matrix multiplication is everywhere. 3D graphics in video games, image manipulation in Photoshop, page ranking in a Google search, and much, much more – all require matrix multiplication. Even if you don’t like computers, matrix operations are used for proportioning chemicals for specific blends of paint, optimizing resources for agriculture, and even a musician generating new melodies by transforming musical scales and chord progressions.

But what is matrix multiplication? Formally, it is defined as a binary operation that produces a new matrix by taking the dot product of each row from A and each column of B. I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed, but this definition makes zero sense to me. This is how it was taught to me in a college linear algebra class, and for the longest time I struggled understanding the essence of matrix multiplication. As a college student studying statistics and data science, matrix operations and linear algebra seemed to be everywhere. 

Since then, my fear of matrices has turned into a love for them because of their wide-ranging utility. The rest of this post will walk you through an example that has helped me gain intuition for matrix multiplication.

## Calculating Calories

Let’s say you're making dinner. Your friends Alice and Julia both recommended dinner recipes for you to try. Your new year’s resolution was to eat healthier, so you compare the total calories of each recipe. You see that Alice’s recipe calls for 180g of rice and 300g of fatty beef, while Julia’s recipe calls for 150g of pasta and 350g of sausage. 

Which meal has fewer calories? I encourage you to take a second to think through how you would calculate the answer.

A quick Google search tells us that each gram of carbohydrates contains 4 calories, and each gram of fat contains 9 calories. To keep things simple, we’ll talk about protein later. We can do the following:

$$
\begin{align*}
180 \, \text{g} \times 4 \, \text{cal/g} &= 720 \: \text{calories for carbs} \\
300 \, \text{g} \times 9 \, \text{cal/g} &= 2700 \: \text{calories for fats} \\
720 \, \text{cal} + 2700 \, \text{cal} &= 3420 \: \text{calories for Alice's recipe}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
150 \, \text{g} \times 4 \, \text{cal/g} &= 600 \: \text{calories for carbs} \\
350 \, \text{g} \times 9 \, \text{cal/g} &= 3150 \: \text{calories for fats} \\
600 \, \text{cal} + 3150 \, \text{cal} &= 3750 \: \text{calories for Julia's recipe}
\end{align*}
$$



Since Alice’s recipe has fewer calories, that’s the one we’ll cook. Now, having to write down these equations every time I want a recipe’s calories is too much work. It would be even more trouble if I wanted to compare more recipes, or include the calories from protein. There must be some way to simplify things. 

Let’s develop a new process that reduces clutter. In the above calculations, we notice a pattern: first, scale each type of food by its calorie content. Then, add up the components to get the total calories. This operation boils down to scaling or weighting (multiplication) and then combining (addition). To keep the focus on these two basic arithmetic steps, we strip away everything else until we have only the bare-minimum necessary information: the numbers. 


$$
\begin{array}{l  l}
\text{Recipe 1: } 180 \, \text{g of rice}, 300 \, \text{g of beef} & \text{Calories: } 4 \, \text{cal/g of carbs}, 9 \, \text{cal/g of fats} \\
\text{Recipe 2: } 150 \, \text{g of pasta}, 350 \, \text{g of sausage} & \\
\end{array}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$	

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}
& \text{Carb} & \text{Fat} \\
\text{Recipe 1} & 180 & 300 \\
\text{Recipe 2} & 150 & 350
\end{array}
\hspace{1cm} % Adds 1cm of horizontal space
\begin{array}{c}
\vphantom{9 \, \text{cal/g of fat}} \\
4 \, \text{cal/g of carb} \\
9 \, \text{cal/g of fat}
\end{array}
$$


$$
\downarrow
$$

$$
\begin{array}{cc c}
180 & 300 & \hspace{1cm} 4 \\
150 & 350 & \hspace{1cm} 9
\end{array}
$$



So we have the amount of food in grams on the left, and the calories per gram on the right. For clarity, let’s put a box around these two separate chunks of information and give them names.


$$
\overset{\mathrm{\large Amounts}}{\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
180\text{g} & 300\text{g} \\
150\text{g} & 350\text{g}
\end{array}
\right]}
\quad
\overset{\mathrm{\large Calorie \, content}}{\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \, \text{cal/g} \\
9 \, \text{cal/g}
\end{array}
\right]}
$$



These boxes of information are each called a **matrix**. Matrices are usually represented by a capital letter, so we’ll just use the first letters of the names of each matrix.

$$
\overset{\mathrm{\large A}}{\left[ \begin{matrix} 180 & 300 \\ 150 & 350 \end{matrix} \right]}
\quad
\overset{\mathrm{\large C}}{\left[ \begin{matrix} 4 \\ 9 \end{matrix} \right]}
$$




For matrix \\(A\\), information about Alice’s recipe is in the first row, and information about Julia’s recipe is in the second row. Carb amount is in the first (left) column, and fat amount is in the second (right) column. Matrix \\(C\\) is just the calories per gram of each macronutrient.

Now that we have our two chunks of information, how do we get the total calories of each recipe? Recall that we took the amount of carbs, multiplied it by the calories per gram of carbs, and did the same for fats, then combined them.

In case you need a refresher for the operation procedures, here's a helpful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20pycEx1dSI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.

For Alice's recipe, we only use only the first row of \\(A\\):

$$
\require{xcolor}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
\color{green}{180} & \color{blue}{300} \\
150 & 350
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\color{green}{4} \\
\color{blue}{9}
\end{array}
\right]
=
{\color{green}{180}} \, (\text{carb}) \times {\color{green}{4}} \, (\text{cal}) + {\color{blue}{300}} \, (\text{fat}) \times {\color{blue}{9}} \, (\text{cal}) = {\color{green}{720}} \, \text{cal} + {\color{blue}{2700}} \, \text{cal} = {\color{red}{3420}} \, \text{cal}
$$

And for Julia's recipe we use the second row of \\(A\\):

$$
\require{xcolor}
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
180 & 300 \\
\color{green}{150} & \color{blue}{350}
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\color{green}{4} \\
\color{blue}{9}
\end{array}
\right]
=
{\color{green}{150}} \, (\text{carb}) \times {\color{green}{4}} \, (\text{cal}) + {\color{blue}{350}} \, (\text{fat}) \times {\color{blue}{9}} \, (\text{cal}) = {\color{green}{600}} \, \text{cal} + {\color{blue}{3150}} \, \text{cal} = {\color{orange}{3750}} \, \text{cal}
$$


We end up with this chunk of information, which is the total calories of each recipe. Let’s also put a box around it and give it a name so that we don’t get it confused with the others.

$$
\overset{\mathrm{\large T \, (\text{Total calories})}}{\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\color{red}{3420} \\
\color{orange}{3750}
\end{array}
\right]}
$$


Recall that the rows of the matrix \\(A\\) correspond to each recipe, just like matrix \\(T\\). So if we are looking for Alice’s recipe information, we just look at the first row of \\(A\\) or \\(T\\).

Let’s recap: we have the ingredients of each meal, and we have general macronutrient calories. We broke up each recipe into its carbs and fats, scaled each by their respective calorie content, then combined them to get the total calories of each recipe. This process can be simplified to the following:

For any one recipe, 

$$
\begin{align}
\text{Amount of food} \times \text{Calorie content} &= \text{Total calories}
\end{align}
$$

To do the same thing for all recipes, we multiply the Amounts matrix by the Calorie matrix, and get the Total calories matrix:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
180 & 300 \\
150 & 350
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9
\end{array}
\right]
= 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
3420 \\
3750
\end{array}
\right]
$$

$$
A \times C = T
$$

Not to be confused with basic multiplication of two numbers, this is matrix multiplication, which is scaling the components of each item, then combining the results to get the total value of each item.

So we’ve successfully developed a method of getting the total calories of Alice and Julia’s recipes. At this point, you may think that matrix multiplication is more trouble than it’s worth. After all, the usual method of thinking through the problem and punching some numbers into a calculator seems to work just fine. 

But what if you were given a few more recipes from your friends, and had to get the calories of each of those recipes? Realistically, we won’t go through that much trouble at home, but what if you were a hospital dietician tasked with planning calorically controlled meals for hundreds of patients with dietary restrictions? Wouldn’t you have to have as many equations as there are recipes? And what if there are more nutrients to account for, like protein?

This is what’s so cool about matrices: regardless of how many recipes or nutrients there are, if the fundamental operation is the same (in our case, getting the total calories by scaling ingredients by calorie content), then the matrix multiplication \\(A \times C = T\\) is still the same. Whether you have 2 recipes or 200, 2 nutrients or 50, you can still tell a computer to do \\(A \times C\\) and get \\(T\\). 

Here’s what it would look like:


$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & \text{Carb} & \text{Fat} & \text{Protein} \\
\hline
\text{Recipe 1} & 180 & 300 & 50 \\
\text{Recipe 2} & 150 & 350 & 100 \\
\text{Recipe 3} & 130 & 290 & 70 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\text{Recipe 50} & 125 & 315 & 80
\end{array}
\quad
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Carb} & 4 \\
\text{Fat} & 9 \\
\text{Protein} & 4
\end{array}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$	

$$
\overset{\mathrm{\large A}}{\vphantom{A}\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
180 & 300 & 50 \\
150 & 350 & 100 \\
130 & 290 & 70 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
125 & 315 & 80
\end{array}
\right]}
\quad
\overset{\mathrm{\large C}}{\vphantom{C}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9 \\
4
\end{array}
\right]}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$	

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
180 & 300 & 50 \\
150 & 350 & 100 \\
130 & 290 & 70 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
125 & 315 & 80
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9 \\
4
\end{array}
\right]
\quad
=
\quad
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
3620 \\
4150 \\
3410 \\
\vdots \\
3655
\end{array}
\right]
$$

This is the resulting matrix T:

$$
\overset{\mathrm{\large T}}{\left[
\begin{array}{c}
3620 \\
4150 \\
3410 \\
\vdots \\
3655
\end{array}
\right]}
$$


Where each number represents the total calories of the corresponding recipe, accounting for all nutrients.

Thus we see that one of the strengths of matrix multiplication is scalability. If we only had one recipe with one macronutrient, simple multiplication will do. If we have more than one recipe and more than one nutrient, matrix multiplication does it better. As long as we have a high-level understanding of how to get the calories of one recipe, we can just do the same thing to all other recipes. 

Of course, a computer would do the dirty work for us. A computer’s central and graphics processors are essentially matrix multipliers. Depending on matrix size and hardware specifications, computers can multiply anywhere from thousands to even trillions of matrices *per second*. With the amount of matrices behind a LLM like ChatGPT, it is no wonder that computing hardware companies like Nvidia have seen their stocks rise exponentially over the years.

## Conclusion

Computations that would otherwise take us hours can be done by a computer in seconds. But in the end, a computer only knows how to multiply and add. We need to tell it *what* to multiply and add. To gain intuition in mathematics is to gain proficiency in technology. Truly understanding linear algebra, as opposed to memorizing rules, will allow us to leverage the strengths of computers. 

One high-level meaning of matrix multiplication introduced in this post can be summarized as follows: **simple multiplication gives us the effect of one factor on one item. Matrix multiplication gives us the aggregate effect of any number of factors on any number of items.**

For me, learning linear algebra in school was tough because of the lack of real-world examples that motivate why we need to have matrices. Seeing this example of recipes and calories has helped me understand the essence of matrix multiplication. I hope this has been helpful for you too. I would very much appreciate any feedback regarding the content and pedagogy of this post for future adjustments.
