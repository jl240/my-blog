## Introduction

Matrix multiplication is everywhere. 3D graphics in video games, image manipulation in Photoshop, transformations of large datasets, cybersecurity encryption, page ranking in a Google search, training machine learning models, and much, much more – all require matrix multiplication. A computer’s central and graphics processors are essentially matrix multipliers. Depending on matrix size and hardware specifications, computers can multiply anywhere from thousands to even trillions of matrices per second. It is no wonder that computing hardware companies like Nvidia have seen their stocks rise exponentially over the years. Even if you don’t like computers, matrix operations are used for proportioning chemicals for specific blends of paint, calculating business or family expenses, optimizing resources for agriculture, and even a musician generating new melodies by transforming musical scales and chord progressions.

But what is matrix multiplication? Formally, it is defined as a binary operation in linear algebra that produces a new matrix from matrices A and B by taking the dot product of each row from A and each column of B. I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed, but this definition makes zero sense to me. This is how it was taught to me in a college linear algebra class, and for the longest time I struggled with figuring out how to think about matrix multiplication. Simple multiplication makes sense – 10 $\times$ 8 can be thought of as 10 eights. Simple addition makes sense – it’s just putting stuff together. But matrix multiplication just did not click. As a college student studying statistics and data science, matrix operations and linear algebra seemed to be everywhere. 

Since then, my fear of matrices has turned into a love for them because of their wide-ranging utility. Dissecting matrix operations has been helpful for me to understand the “why” behind linear algebra. The rest of this post will walk you through an example that has helped me gain intuition in matrix multiplication. It will build up the process from the ground up, so it’s okay if you don’t know what matrix multiplication is yet.

## Calculating Calories

Let’s say you are about to make dinner. Recently, your friends Alice and Julia both recommended dinner recipes for you to try. Your new year’s resolution was to eat healthier, so you want to compare the total calories of each recipe. You look at the ingredient list and see that Alice’s recipe calls for 180g of rice and 300g of fatty beef, while Julia’s recipe calls for 150g of cooked pasta and 350g of sausage. Which meal has fewer calories? I encourage you to take a second to think through how you would calculate the answer.

A quick Google search tells us that each gram of carbohydrates contains 4 calories, and each gram of fat contains 9 calories. To keep the problem simple, we’ll talk about protein later. We can do the following:

$$
180 \, \text{g} \times 4 \, \text{cal/g} = 720 \, \text{calories for carbs} \\
300 \, \text{g} \times 9 \, \text{cal/g} = 2700 \, \text{calories for fats} \\
720 \, \text{cal} + 2700 \, \text{cal} = 3420 \, \text{calories for Alice's recipe}
$$

$$
150 \, \text{g} \times 4 \, \text{cal/g} = 600 \, \text{calories for carbs} \\
350 \, \text{g} \times 9 \, \text{cal/g} = 3150 \, \text{calories for fats} \\
600 \, \text{cal} + 3150 \, \text{cal} = 3750 \, \text{calories for Julia's recipe}
$$



Since Alice’s recipe has fewer calories, that’s the one we’ll cook. Now, having to write down those equations above every time I want a recipe’s calories seems like too much work. It would be even more trouble if I wanted to compare more recipes, or get the calories from protein. There must be some way to simplify things. 

Let’s develop a new process that reduces clutter. In doing the above calculations, we notice a pattern: first, scale the amount of food by its calorie content. Then, to get the total calories of a meal, we just add up the calories of its components. This operation boils down to scaling or weighting (multiplication) and then combining (addition). To keep the focus on these two basic arithmetic steps, we take the information of food and calories that we have and strip away everything else until we have only the bare-minimum necessary information: the numbers. 


$$
\begin{array}{l  l}
\text{Recipe 1:} 180 \, \text{g of rice}, 300 \, \text{g of beef} & \text{Calories:} 4 \, \text{cal/g of carbs}, 9 \, \text{cal/g of fats} \\
\text{Recipe 2:} 150 \, \text{g of pasta}, 350 \, \text{g of sausage} & \\
\end{array}
$$

$$
\downarrow
$$	

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}
& \text{Carb} & \text{Fat} \\
\text{Recipe 1} & 180 & 300 \\
\text{Recipe 2} & 150 & 350
\end{array}
\hspace{1cm} % Adds 1cm of horizontal space
\begin{array}{c}
\vphantom{9 \, \text{cal/g of fat}} \\
4 \, \text{cal/g of carb} \\
9 \, \text{cal/g of fat}
\end{array}
$$


$$
\downarrow
$$

$$
\begin{array}{cc c}
180 & 300 & \hspace{1cm} 4 \\
150 & 350 & \hspace{1cm} 9
\end{array}
$$



So we have the amount of food in grams on the left, and the calories per gram on the right. For clarity, let’s put a box around these two separate chunks of information and give them names.


$$
\overset{\raisebox{1ex}{\large Amounts}}{\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
180\text{g} & 300\text{g} \\
150\text{g} & 350\text{g}
\end{array}
\right]}
\quad
\overset{\raisebox{1ex}{\large Calorie content}}{\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \, \text{cal/g} \\
9 \, \text{cal/g}
\end{array}
\right]}
$$



These boxes of information are each called a matrix. Usually, matrices are represented by a capital letter, so we’ll just use the first letters of the names of each matrix.

$$
\overset{\raisebox{1ex}{\large A}}{\left[ \begin{matrix} 180 & 300 \\ 150 & 350 \end{matrix} \right]}
\quad
\overset{\raisebox{1ex}{\large C}}{\left[ \begin{matrix} 4 \\ 9 \end{matrix} \right]}
$$




For matrix A, information about Alice’s recipe is in the first row, and information about Julia’s recipe is in the second row. Carb amount is in the first (left) column, and fat amount is in the second (right) column. Matrix C is just the calories per gram of each macronutrient.

Now that we have our two chunks of information, how do we get the desired result of the total calories of each recipe? Recall that we took the amount of carbs, multiplied it by the calories per gram of carbs, and did the same for fats, then combined them. 

Alice's recipe, we only use only the first row of A:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
180 & 300 \\
150 & 350
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9
\end{array}
\right]
=
180 \, (\text{carb}) \times 4 \, (\text{cal}) + 300 \, (\text{fat}) \times 9 \, (\text{cal}) = 720 \, \text{cal} + 2700 \, \text{cal} = 3420 \, \text{cal}
$$

And for Julia's recipe we only use the second row of A:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
180 & 300 \\
150 & 350
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9
\end{array}
\right]
=
150 \, (\text{carb}) \times 4 \, (\text{cal}) + 350 \, (\text{fat}) \times 9 \, (\text{cal}) = 600 \, \text{cal} + 3150 \, \text{cal} = 3750 \, \text{cal}
$$


We end up with the resulting chunk of information, which is the total calories of each recipe. Let’s also put a box around it and give it a name so that we don’t get it confused with other information.

$$
\overset{\raisebox{0.5ex}{\large T \, (\text{Total calories})}}{\left[
\begin{array}{c}
3420 \\
3750
\end{array}
\right]}
$$


Recall that the rows of the matrix A correspond to each recipe, just like matrix T. So if we are looking for Alice’s recipe information, we just look at the first row of A or T.

Let’s recap: we have the ingredients of each meal, and we have general macronutrient calories. We broke up each recipe into its amount of carbs and fats, scaled each of them by their respective calorie content, then combined them to get the total calories of each recipe. This process can be simplified to the following:

For any one recipe, 
$$ \\
\text{Amount of food} \times \text{Calorie content} = \text{Total calories}
$$

So to do the same thing for all recipes, we multiply the Amounts matrix by the Calorie matrix, and get the Total calories matrix:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{cc}
180 & 300 \\
150 & 350
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9
\end{array}
\right]
= 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
3420 \\
3750
\end{array}
\right]
$$

$$
A \times C = T
$$

Not to be confused with basic multiplication of two numbers, this is matrix multiplication, which is scaling the components of each item by the appropriate amount, then combining the results to get the grand total value of each item. Keep in mind that the matrices A and T include information about all the recipes in question. 

So we’ve successfully developed a method of getting the total calories of Alice and Julia’s recipes. At this point, you may think that matrix multiplication is more trouble than it’s worth. After all, the usual method of thinking through the problem and punching some numbers into a calculator seems to work just fine. But what if you were given a few more recipes from your friends, and you had to do the math to figure out the calorie content of each of those recipes so that you can pick the one with the fewest calories? Realistically, we don’t go through that much trouble in meal planning at home, but what if you were a hospital dietician tasked with planning calorically controlled meals for hundreds of patients with dietary restrictions? Wouldn’t you have to have as many equations as there are recipes? And what if there are more nutrients to account for, like protein? Would we have to develop another process to calculate the calories?

This is what’s so cool about matrices: regardless of how many recipes there are or how many nutrients we need to account for, if the fundamental operation is the same (in our case, getting the total calories of each recipe by scaling the ingredients by their calorie content), then the matrix multiplication A $\times$ C $=$ T is still the same. Whether you have 2 recipes or 200, 2 nutrients or 50, you can still tell the computer to do A $\times$ C and get T. 

Here’s what it would look like:


$$
\begin{array}{c|ccc}
 & \text{Carb} & \text{Fat} & \text{Protein} \\
\hline
\text{Recipe 1} & 180 & 300 & 50 \\
\text{Recipe 2} & 150 & 350 & 100 \\
\text{Recipe 3} & 130 & 290 & 70 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\text{Recipe 50} & 125 & 315 & 80
\end{array}
\quad
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Carb} & 4 \\
\text{Fat} & 9 \\
\text{Protein} & 4
\end{array}
$$

$$
\overset{\Large A}{\vphantom{A}\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
180 & 300 & 50 \\
150 & 350 & 100 \\
130 & 290 & 70 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
125 & 315 & 80
\end{array}
\right]}
\quad
\overset{\Large C}{\vphantom{C}\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9 \\
4
\end{array}
\right]}
$$


$$
\left[
\begin{array}{ccc}
180 & 300 & 50 \\
150 & 350 & 100 \\
130 & 290 & 70 \\
125 & 315 & 80
\end{array}
\right]
\times
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
4 \\
9 \\
4
\end{array}
\right]
\quad
=
\quad
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
3620 \\
4150 \\
3410 \\
3655
\end{array}
\right]
$$

This is the resulting matrix T:

$$
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
3620 \\
4150 \\
3410 \\
3655
\end{array}
\right]
$$

Where each number represents the total calories of the corresponding recipe, accounting for all macronutrients.

Thus we see that one of the strengths of matrix multiplication is scalability. If we only had one recipe with one macronutrient, simple multiplication will get us the total calories. If we have more than one recipe and more than one macronutrient, matrix multiplication does the job better. As long as we have a high-level understanding of how to get the calorie content of one recipe, we can just do the same thing to all other recipes in our list. Of course, a computer would do the math for us. We put in the effort of thinking through the process of how to get the result, and then we let the computer do the dirty work of multiplication and addition. 

## Conclusion

Computations that would otherwise take us hours can easily be done by a computer in seconds. But in the end, a computer only knows how to multiply and add. We need to tell it *what* to multiply and add. To gain intuition in mathematics is to gain proficiency in technology. Truly understanding linear algebra, as opposed to memorizing rules, will allow us to leverage the strengths of computers. In this post, we have attempted to understand the motivation behind matrix multiplication by building up the process from the ground up using a practical and relatable example. Matrix multiplication has many other high-level meanings other than what was discussed, but this post only allows room for one common usage. In summary: **simple multiplication gives us the effect of one factor on one item. Matrix multiplication gives us the aggregate effect of any number of factors on any number of items.**

For me personally, learning linear algebra in school was tough because of the lack of real-world examples that motivate why we need to have matrices and multiply them in the first place. Seeing this example of recipes and calories has helped me understand the essence of matrix multiplication. I hope this has been helpful for you too. I would very much appreciate any feedback regarding the content and pedagogy so that I can make adjustments in the future.
